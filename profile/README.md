# CODE OF CONDUCT 

## OUR PLEDGE
Welcome to HackBeats, a tech community aimed for encouraging and promoting public speaking,communication skills, soft skills, best practices, technical expertise and opensource contribution in the field of Computer Science via conducting workshops , hackathons and mentorship sessions in an inclusive and welcoming environment

## OUR MOTO 
- Treat everyone with respect and kindness.
- Be thoughtful in how you communicate.
- Don't be destructive or inflammatory.

## WHERE DOES THE CODE OF CONDUCT APPLY 

If you join in or contribute to our club ecosystem in any way, you are encouraged to follow the Code of Conduct/

Explicit enforcement of the Code of Conduct applies to all official workshops, in-person meetings, and events including:

- The Slack & Discord channel 
- The Events, including AMAs, Gaming Nights, Zoom study call, work shops and mentorship sessions 
- The GitHub projects
- Club Meetings

## OUR VALUES 

- Be friendly and welcoming
- Be patient
   - Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language (meaning and tone can be lost in translation).
- Be thoughtful
   - Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
   - Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
- Be respectful
   - In particular, respect differences of opinion.
- Be charitable
   - Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.
   - When we do disagree, try to understand why.
- Avoid destructive behavior:
   - Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
   - Unconstructive criticism: don't merely condemn the current state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.
   - Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)
   - Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.
   - Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral, and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group.

## UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR

- Expressing or provoking:
  - Insulting, demeaning, hateful, or threatening remarks;
  - Biscrimination based on age, nationality, race, (dis)ability, gender (identity or expression), sexuality, religion, or similar personal characteristic;
  - Bullying or systematic harassment;
  - unwelcome sexual advances, including sexually explicit content.
- Advertisement or recruitment for events, companies, organizations, etc - unless specifically given permission by Hack Club HQ.
- Posting spam-like content that disrupts the environment of the community.

## ISSUE REPORTING
